# ChangesReloaded [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HPI-SWA-Teaching/ChangesBrowser.svg?branch=team09)](https://travis-ci.org/HPI-SWA-Teaching/ChangesBrowser)

ChangesReloaded is a project developed in context of SWT 2020 based on the Changes Browser project from 2017. It is supposed to simplify the old tool.

## Installation
In order to use our tool, you have to install it in your squeak image. You can either do that by using the Git Browser or by using the Monticello Browser.

### Git Browser
- Open the Git Browser in your squeak image (`Tools>Git Browser` or `Apps>Git Browser`).
- Right click on `-- Projects --` and choose `Clone project`.
- Copy and paste the URL of the project on GitHub (https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/ChangesBrowser.git) and click "Accept".
- Now choose the `origin/dev`-branch in the branch overview.
- Right click on the latest commit on top of the list and choose `Checkout objects`.

### Monticello Browser
- Execute the following code in a Workspace (`Tools>Workspace`)
```
Metacello new
    baseline: 'Changes';
    repository: 'github://hpi-swa-teaching/ChangesBrowser:dev/packages';
    load.
```

After you installed the tool through one of those options you have to execute 'CRBrowser open' in a Workspace in order to work with it.
