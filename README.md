ChangesReloaded is a project developed in context of SWT 2020 based on the ChangesBrowser project from 2017. It is supposed to simplify the old tool.

## Installation
In order to use our tool, you have to install it in your Squeak image. Our preferred way is to use Squeak's Git Browser.

### Git Browser
- Open the Git Browser in your Squeak image (<kbd>Tools</kbd> → <kbd>Git Browser</kbd> or <kbd>Apps</kbd> → <kbd>Git Browser</kbd>).
- Right click on `-- Projects --` and choose <kbd>Clone project</kbd>.
- Copy and paste the Git URL of this project (https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/ChangesBrowser.git) and click <kbd>Accept</kbd>.
- Now choose the `origin/dev` branch in the branch overview.
- Right click on the latest commit on top of the list and choose <kbd>Checkout objects</kbd>.
- For later updates, you can just pull the new version from the Git Repository. To do that, select the `dev` branch and click the button <kbd>Pull</kbd>.
- Once the new version was downloaded, right click the latest commit and choose <kbd>Checkout objects</kbd>.

### Usage
After you installed the tool you have to execute `CRBrowser open` in a Workspace in order to work with it. Alternatively, you can open it from the `CHBrowser` with the button <kbd>Switch to simple view</kbd>.
